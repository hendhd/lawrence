    "# Object Oriented\n",
    "Python is a object oriented language. Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on \"objects\" which contain data and code (or \"attributs\" and \"methods\"). Other programming paradigms are imperitive or functional programming. You can do both in python, and to some extend will mix these concepts all the time. A object oriented language per se treats all data as objects and provides methods on the data. Let's see how Python does this:\n",
    "## Variables and Objects\n",
    "When assigning a variable, the intuitive idea is that the variable is a container for the actual data. In Python this is different. Whenever data is called, python will make an object from it:"

    "The result you see is \"300\" in the output, but what happened is: Python built an object, gave it the value 300, and displayed it. Since there is no further assignemnt to this object, it is orphaned and will be destructed. So let's use it a bit differently:"

    "We built an object with the value of 300 and assigned to the variable a (or we named it a). Then we took the name b and assigned to a, so both are now references to the *same* object. \n",
    "With the function id() I can access the object identifier and you see that a and b refer to the same object. When I assigned c, Python made a new object, then gave it the value 300, and then assigned the name c to it, thus, the object identifier is a different one than for a and b.\n",
    "A good way to understand what is meant with objects in programming is to think about objects in the world: consider your family has a cat named \"Florence\".  Each member of your family might refer to her differently: one may say \"flory\", another one may call her \"kittykittykitty\" and another on simply as \"cute fur ball\". If we ask the neighbour, who is a passionate gardener and frequently has to deal with Florences leftovers between the plants, she might use \"******* black devil\". Florence though won't care much and will always be the same object in the world. \n",
    "Think of variables as a reference to an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen with the data types before, the functionality of variables depends on the data they are refering to. Hence the basic datatypes from python come with properties and methods which are frequently used. See the following:\n"
