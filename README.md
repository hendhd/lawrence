This is a collection of jupyter notebooks used to support a group of students at Lawrence Academy. The aim is to bring Python skills to a level which will enable to access data using PyVO and TAP services. The students have some experience with python, hence the bit off order of topics. We will discover what's needed on the fly and add it to the notebooks.
